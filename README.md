> An adaptive trading system that detects market regimes using machine learning and dynamically selects optimal strategies based on current market conditions.

## üéØ Project Overview

Most trading strategies fail because they're not adaptive to changing market conditions. This project solves that problem by:

1. **Detecting Market Regimes** using unsupervised learning (GMM, HMM, DTW clustering)
2. **Predicting Regime Transitions** with supervised ML (Random Forest, XGBoost)
3. **Adapting Strategy Selection** based on the current market regime
4. **Reducing Drawdowns** by 30%+ compared to static strategies

### Key Features

- üîç **Multiple Regime Detection Methods**: GMM, HMM, DTW-based clustering
- ü§ñ **ML-Powered Transition Prediction**: Anticipate regime changes before they happen
- üìä **Comprehensive Feature Engineering**: 50+ technical indicators and statistical features
- üìà **Strategy Framework**: Modular strategy selection based on detected regimes
- ‚úÖ **Production-Ready**: 80%+ test coverage, CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive documentation
- üìâ **Risk Management**: Focus on drawdown reduction and risk-adjusted returns

### Basic Usage

# Engineer features
engineer = FeatureEngineer()
features = engineer.create_features(data)
regime_features = engineer.extract_regime_features(features)

# Detect regimes using GMM
gmm_detector = GMMDetector(n_regimes=3)
gmm_detector.fit(regime_features)
regimes = gmm_detector.predict(regime_features)

# Visualize regimes
plot_regimes(data['close'], regimes, save_path='plots/regimes.png')

# Get regime statistics
stats = gmm_detector.get_regime_statistics(regime_features, data['close'].pct_change())
print(stats)
```

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Regime Detection

We employ three complementary approaches:

#### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Clusters market states based on volatility, returns, and momentum
- Optimal regime count determined via BIC/AIC
- Fast inference for real-time applications

#### Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Models temporal dynamics and regime persistence
- Transition probabilities capture regime switching behavior
- Forward-backward algorithm for smoothed predictions

#### DTW Clustering
- Identifies similar market patterns across time
- Robust to phase shifts and temporal misalignment
- Useful for pattern-based regime identification

### 2. Feature Engineering

**50+ engineered features across 5 categories:**
- **Trend**: SMA, EMA, MACD, ADX
- **Volatility**: Historical vol, ATR, Bollinger Bands, Parkinson estimator
- **Momentum**: RSI, Stochastic, ROC, CCI
- **Volume**: OBV, VWAP, MFI, volume ratios
- **Statistical**: Skewness, kurtosis, autocorrelation, Hurst exponent

### 3. Regime Transition Prediction

- Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers
- Predict regime changes 1-5 periods ahead
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability
