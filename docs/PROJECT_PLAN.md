# Project Plan: Market Regime Detection & Adaptive Strategy Selection

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Build an adaptive trading system that detects market regimes and dynamically selects optimal strategies based on current market conditions.

**Problem Statement:** Most trading strategies fail because they're not adaptive to changing market conditions. This project aims to solve this by using machine learning to identify market regimes and select appropriate strategies.
